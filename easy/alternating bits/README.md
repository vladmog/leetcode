Given a positive integer, check whether it has alternating bits: namely, if two adjacent bits will always have different values.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5
Output: true
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is: 101

---

Example 2:

Input: n = 7
Output: false
Explanation: The binary representation of 7 is: 111.

---

Example 3:

Input: n = 11
Output: false
Explanation: The binary representation of 11 is: 1011.

---

Example 4:

Input: n = 10
Output: true
Explanation: The binary representation of 10 is: 1010.

---

Example 5:

Input: n = 3
Output: false
 
 ---
